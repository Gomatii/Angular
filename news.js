It’s a so-so start for the roughly $20 million-budgeted movie.\n\nDespite the newcomer, last weekend’s champ “Kung Fu Panda 4” is expected to dominate again with roughly $28 million to $30 million in its sophomore outing. So far, the animated fourquel has grossed $62 million at the domestic box office and $93 million globally.\n\n“Dune: Part Two” won’t be far behind “Panda” as the sci-fi adventure looks to continue its impressive box office run. The “Dune” sequel is projected to add $24 million to $27 million during its third weekend of release. After 12 days on the big screen, “Dune 2” has"

Industry observers have cited various barriers to Asian animation co-productions, including political, structural, legal and cultural issues.\n\nIn China especially, where the appetite for Japanese and other foreign animation once seemed unlimited, connections with the Japanese anime industry have become strained, if not severed.\n\nOne reason is a 2020 law aimed at protecting minors that bans anyone under 16 from owning a streaming account and prohibits audio-visual content with “obscenity, pornography, violence, cults, superstitions, gambling, inducements to suicide,"

In this film, Aster uses horror tropes as a tool to examine fears about motherhood, mental health, and the impact of grief. Many horror movies have drawn on real-life cases to scare viewers like The Amityville Horror, The Uninvited, and Blumhouse’s Conjuring franchise. To be clear: Hereditary is entirely fictional, but Aster has been vocal about how he conveys his own fears about death and existential horror via his storytelling."
